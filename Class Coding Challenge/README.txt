This project was made in 2022 when the class had 3 hours to 
make a game within 3 hours, and my provided prompt was a game where 
it involves rolling a dice among 3 other people. Those who manage 
to roll every unique dice without reptition under 12 rolls wins, or 
at 12 rolls the one with the least amount of score wins.
