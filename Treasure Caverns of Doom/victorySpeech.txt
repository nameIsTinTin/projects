As you walk out, blood drips from your feet. Your sword jagged with every blow. 
Your eye popping out of its socket, your teeth dangling from your jaw. 
Despite looking like the worst, the old man who assigned you his ungodly duties 
paraded your deeds throughout the village (even though he stole the artefacts from you), 
you are known as the one who conquered the... TREASURE CAVERNS OF DOOM !
